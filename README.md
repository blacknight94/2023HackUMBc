This project was completed in 24 hours at the 2023 UMBC hackathon to compete in the health/enviormental hack and finance categories. This project is designed to provide a front end user exeperience through a web app providing users the ability to enter a stock ticker. In response the website will then return relavant data about the stock with a focus on enviromental impact and ratings such as ESG score. For an additional feature reccent articles will also be displayed about the company the user enters. There was a large amount of data that we where able to collect using api's and webscrapping from yahoo finance but a large portion of that data was not able to get into the final product due to time constraints.

My contributions:
- i was responsible for front end developement utilizing HTML and CSS as well as flask to run a local verison of the website. This was my first time doing any front end developement.
  (p.s. the reason my commits dont show up was due to me having a typo in my email for git config)

common packages needed for website to work
numpy
flask
python
requests
